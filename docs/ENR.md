I think for #1  we need to innovate here, by that might mean, all three  (A3 => Entroy-Nexus-Revial) sould be layers on top of something new, we'll call "entropy nexus revivial"  : 

Here is a breakdown of its definition based on  context :





It is a Foundational Layer: The user suggests it as a new innovation that sits underneath or supports three other pricing models: fixed rates, dynamic supply/demand, and auction-based systems.



It is an Economic Primitive: It is designed to answer the question regarding "Market Mechanics" and how credit pricing should function within the "VUDO" orchestration platform.



Contextual Meaning: While not explicitly defined in technical terms in the image, the name suggests a blend of physics and network theory:





Entropy: Likely refers to managing system disorder, waste, or energy loss (fitting with the "thermodynamic" and "biological" themes visible in the chat history).



Nexus: Represents a central connection point or hub within the network.



Revival: Implies a cycle of restoration or renewing resources, similar to how biological systems (like the fungal "Hyphal Network" mentioned in the chat) recycle nutrients.

In short, I proposed hybrid economic model intended to innovate beyond standard pricing strategies by acting as a unifying base layer for the platform's economy.







 Hierarchical (hub nodes aggregate) - hybrid  ...but aim of full gossip when possible.


All of the above with configurable weights
